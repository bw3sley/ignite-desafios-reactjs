# Ignite - ReactJS
During my studies in the Rocketseat Ignite program, I focused mainly on ReactJS, using TypeScript and libraries such as styled-components, stitches, json-server, axios and many others. These projects gave me an in-depth understanding of front-end web development and helped me develop robust and scalable applications. I am excited to continue honing my skills and exploring new technologies in the field of web development.
